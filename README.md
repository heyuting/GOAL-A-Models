# Model Visualization Web Application

A React-based web application for visualizing and exploring different environmental models including SCEPTER, DRN, and ATS.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20.11.1 or later recommended)
- npm (latest version)

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/heyuting/GOAL-A-Models.git
cd GOAL-A-Models
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Application

### Development Mode

To run the application in development mode with hot-reload:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## Available Models

- **SCEPTER** (Soil Cycles of Elements simulator for Predicting TERrestrial regulation of greenhouse gases): A 1D reactive transport model for simulating enhanced rock weathering.
- **DRN** (Dynamic River Network): A model for quantifying the impact of enhanced weathering on river carbonate chemistry.
- **ATS** (Advanced Terrestrial Simulator): A tool for handling complex reactive transport in hydrology models.
